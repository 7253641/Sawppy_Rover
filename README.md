# Sawppy the Six-Wheeled Rover

Sawppy Rover was inspired by SGVHAK Rover, a six-wheeled robot inspired by the NASA JPL rovers sent to explore Mars. The major differences between Sawppy and the SGVHAK Rover were motivated by a desire to reduce cost and complexity. To accomplish this goal, design for Sawppy differs in two major design goals:

* Motorization: Instead of using gearmotors with encoders managed by RoboClaw motor controllers, moving the wheels will be done with servo motors.
* Construction Method: Instead of using the [Actobotics construction system](https://www.servocity.com/actobotics), Sawppy will be built from [Misumi HFS3 aluminum extrusions](https://us.misumi-ec.com/vona2/detail/110300465870/) connected by 3D-printed plastic parts

These two major design goals can be summarized as: **S**ervo **A**ctuated **W**heels, **P**rinted **I**nterconnect **F**or **E**xtrusion. The acronym SAWPIFE led to the nickedname "Sawppy".
