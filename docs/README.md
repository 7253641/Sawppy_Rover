# Instructions

This directory has information for building your own Sawppy the Rover

## 3D Printed Components
[General overview](Print%20Overview.md) of 3D-printed rover parts.

Details:
* [Servo accessories](Print%20Servo%20Parts.md)
* [Steering knuckle](Print%20Steering%20Knuckle.md)
* [Fixed knuckle](Print%20Fixed%20Knuckle.md)
* [Wheel](Print%20Wheel.md)
* [Wheel hub](Print%20Wheel%20Hub.md)
* [Corner Steering Joints](Print%20Corner%20Steering%20Joints.md)
* [Suspension Bogie Joints](Print%20Suspension%20Bogie%20Joints.md)
* [Suspension Rocker Joints](Print%20Suspension%20Rocker%20Joints.md)
* [Main Body Box Corners](Print%20Body%20Box%20Corners.md)
* [Differential](Print%20Differential.md)
* [M3 Nut Installation Tool](Print%20M3%20Installation%20Tool.md)

## Customized Metal Components
* [15mm square aluminum extrusion beams](Misumi%20HFS%203.md)
* [8mm diameter shafts](Shaft8mm.md)

## Mechanical Assembly
For an overview of the construction technique used here, combining aluminum extrusion beams with
3D printed connectors plus using design-specific M3 nut installation tools, please 
[see this article on Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2018/05/08/how-to-build-anything-out-of-aluminum-extrusion-and-3d-printed-brackets/).

If any part of the assembly instructions are unclear, consult 
[the CAD file](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/43678ef564a43281c83e1aef/w/392bbf8745395bc24367a35c/e/9bd6bbb7aba50a97523d14f2)
to see how parts are supposed to fit together.

* [Servo Actuator Module](AssembleActuatorModule.md)
* [Wheel Drive Modules](AssembleDriveModules.md)
* [Suspension Pivot Joints](AssemblePivotJoints.md)
* [Main Rover Body](AssembleBody.md)
* [Suspension Differential](AssembleDifferential.md)
* [Suspension Bogie](AssembleBogie.md)
* [Suspension Rocker and final assembly](AssembleRocker.md)

Once all the wheels are bolted on to the suspension, your Sawppy will be mechanically complete!
